Vanilla seems to work this way:
- Success chance of an attack applies when you attempt it. If fail nothing happens, spend energy. If success attack begins. Control immediately gained. Probe happens immediately. Panic/Stun is gradually applied over time, each second unit spends PSI and does its thing

Regen: 1 / sec
Control = 32, 8 / sec (applied each half second)
Panic = 10, 4 / sec (applied each half second) (loss seems to depend on psi def, seen 16, 8)
Stun = 16, 10 / sec (applied each half second) (loss seen only 12, regardless of def)
Probe = 8, 6 / sec (applied each half second) (allows rightclick to probe again)

Assume in TB its the same, just no need for upkeep, works immediately.

Attack continues until cancelled or out of mana.
