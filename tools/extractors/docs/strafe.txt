Strafe is used in two cases:

1) Player requests it 
- Benefit: No need to turn to see enemy behind corner
- Uncompatible with Running or being prone, Unit will always walk
- Along whole way unit will keep relative facing to target

2) Auto strafe in cautious/normal behavior
- Only into adjacent tile
- Unit will pop out when weapon ready to fire, fire, pop back immediately
- Effectively, works like this:
	- Unit chooses to go into "strafe fire mode" and has two tiles to remember: attack tile and cover tile
	- If idle and not in on cover tile: Strafe into cover tile
	- If weapon ready to fire: strafe into attack tile
	
	
[Strafe Attack] is a new BattleUnitMission

Start params:
- Cover tile
- Target

Remember:
- Attack tile (the one we're at)
- Facing

Stops when:
- Unit is given order
- Target is dead and we are on attack tile
- Have LOF to target and we are on cover tile
